# About My Personal Website
Hello everyone, this is Zackery Perski, and you're currently viewing the Git Hub repository storing the ReactJS utilized to build out the website I've hosted below on Amazon's S3 bucket. 

# About Me
I'm a fullstack software developer and STEM educator. I love programming, and it's been a life goal of mine to be a software engineer. </br>I'm passionate about computer science, having obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and minoring in Computer Engineering Technology. After graduating, I continued my journey in education by becoming a Computer Science teacher, where I developed curriculum for students to get an early start in computer programming. During this time I was a FLL coach as well!
